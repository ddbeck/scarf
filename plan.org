Add a package:
  Need some mutable notion of "my environment"
    Config file + nix store path?
  Construct $PATH from package list
Remove a package:
  Modify config file and rebuild
Flexible package names:
  Need to name packages not in scarf package set
  scarf package set explicitly reduces to "nixpkgs in NIX_PATH" for now
  Can specify globally for config file or for one specific package what the host namespace is
Reproducible environment names:
  "my environment" reduces to "env-from-cfg-file" reduces to "env-with-such-and-such-packages"
  need to pass environment names as flag to env subcommand... mutations need to name a mutable senv, enter can be mutable or not
  need to rebuild mutable on top of immutable: config file + state reduces to immutable names

Later: Hashes for names? Combining envs?
